Main idea

make an app that allows a user to track multiple goals every day and display their progress

Challanges
- the daily options will be limited by the sql table(i.e. users will not be able to have their own unique columns.)

login page to sign up with google or own user name
Html page 
- insert data for any date
- edit data
- view an overview of the week
(MySQL Database to store the data)
